# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a functional download link for the Android app in the footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Android download button in the app footer (Layout.tsx) to use a valid download URL instead of the placeholder '#android-download'

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click the Android download button in the footer and be directed to a valid download location for the Android app.
