# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix application startup errors preventing the Calma-Mente app from loading correctly.

**Planned changes:**
- Investigate and resolve errors occurring during app initialization
- Fix Internet Identity authentication initialization issues
- Ensure backend actor connection establishes successfully on startup
- Verify React Query provider setup works without errors
- Test that all routes (welcome, home, breathing, diary) load successfully

**User-visible outcome:** The app loads smoothly on first startup without errors, allowing users to immediately access the welcome screen and navigate to all features without encountering initialization failures.
