  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all three requirements. REQ-27 is fulfilled with IndexPage containing a hero section, feature cards, and getting started section. REQ-28 is fulfilled with the index.html title changed to 'Starter Application'. REQ-29 is verified through the Layout component implementing the header/footer structure. However, the diff shows evidence of Calma-Mente specific features that were explicitly marked as non-goals.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'Implementing any Calma-Mente specific features' as a non-goal and emphasizes maintaining a 'minimal starter template approach without introducing application-specific features'. The diff summary shows multiple Calma-Mente pages and meditation-specific components that contradict the constraint to preserve minimal starter template approach.",
