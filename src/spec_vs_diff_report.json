  "summary": "The implementation successfully adds motivational messages functionality with backend storage, home page display with refresh capability, and post-breathing-cycle messages. However, the messages are in English instead of Portuguese as required, and there are only 10 messages instead of the required 15-20.",

      "reason": "All 10 motivational messages in backend/main.mo are in English (e.g., 'Take a deep breath. You're doing better than you think.'), but the constraint explicitly requires Portuguese messages",
